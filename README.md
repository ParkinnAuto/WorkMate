<h1>WorkMate Website </h1>

The WorkMate website offers tools designed to enhance productivity. Its main feature is the To-do List, which helps users remember their tasks. Additionally, the website includes a Calendar, Notes, Weather, and a Calculator for users to utilize.

<b>To-do List</b>: The To-do List allows users to add, check off, and sort tasks, as well as view remaining incomplete tasks. When users click the "Add Task" button, a modal will appear prompting them to enter the required information. All form inputs must be completed before clicking "Submit."

<b>Calendar</b>: The Calendar displays the current date, and users can navigate to other months by clicking forward or backward.

<b>Notes</b>: Users can utilize the Notes feature to jot down reminders. By adding a note and clicking “Add Note,” the new entry will appear below, and users have the option to delete notes as needed.

<b>Weather</b>: This feature checks the weather at the user’s current location, but users must click "Allow" to share their location. Additionally, users can check the weather in other cities.
